One way is to filter each element by converting to string and then do a modulo to get length
Another way is to have function which calculates the number of digits by dividing by 10s and using that to find digits' length

Best way is to use the constraint conditions to form the below -
10-99 ---- Even digit
1000-9999 --- Even digit
100000 -- Even digit
